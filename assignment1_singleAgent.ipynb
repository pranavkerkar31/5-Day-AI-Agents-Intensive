Born on September 17, 1950, in Vadnagar, Bombay State (present-day Gujarat), he is the first Prime Minister of India to be born after the country gained independence. Modi comes from humble origins and began his journey of public service at a young age.\n",
            "\n",
            "He was introduced to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a right-wing Hindutva paramilitary volunteer organization, at the age of eight, becoming a full-time worker for the organization in Gujarat in 1971. The RSS assigned him to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in 1985, and he steadily rose through the party hierarchy, becoming general secretary in 1998.\n",

            "In 2001, Modi was appointed Chief Minister of Gujarat, a position he held until 2014. During his tenure as Chief Minister, he was recognized for his focus on good governance and development initiatives in the state. In July 2007, he became the longest-serving Chief Minister of Gujarat.\n",

            "Modi was declared the prime ministerial candidate for the Lok Sabha elections in 2014 and led the BJP to a historic victory. He took oath as the Prime Minister of India on May 26, 2014. He was sworn in for a second term in 2019 and, after another decisive victory in the 2024 Parliamentary elections, took oath as India's Prime Minister for the third time on June 9, 2024. This makes him the longest-serving prime minister outside the Indian National Congress.\n",
            "\n",
            "Throughout his time as Prime Minister, Modi has focused on all-round and inclusive development, with a deep inspiration from the principle of 'Antyodaya,' which means serving the last person in the queue. A significant aspect of his tenure has also been a strong focus on foreign policy and international relations, actively engaging with world leaders to promote India's interests globally. He has also effectively utilized social media and platforms like his monthly radio program \"Mann Ki Baat\" to directly communicate with citizens.\n",
